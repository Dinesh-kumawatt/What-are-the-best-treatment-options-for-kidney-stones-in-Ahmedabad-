Kidney stones are hard deposits of minerals and salts that form in the kidneys and can cause severe pain, especially during urination. Symptoms include back or side pain, blood in urine, nausea, and frequent urges to urinate. At Care and Cure Hospital in Ahmedabad, kidney stone treatment is tailored to the size, type, and location of the stone. For small stones, medications and increased water intake may be sufficient. For larger or more painful stones, the hospital offers minimally invasive solutions like laser lithotripsy, shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), and ureteroscopy. In rare cases, surgical removal may be required.
